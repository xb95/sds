sis -- Simple Inventory System

This is designed to be a very very simple inventory system for storing information
about servers, switches, and other devices that you wish to keep track of in your
infrastructure.

In short, this is a JSON storage system.  You create documents and upload them under
some name of your choice and then, later, you can retrieve and update those documents.
That is nearly the entire story.

We do provide some very basic ability to insert validators -- code that can be run
whenever certain actions happen in the system.  You can use this to extend sis to do
whatever it is you need it to do.  I recommend you keep it simple.

there being no damn simple inventory management system.
