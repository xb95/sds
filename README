sds -- Simple Document Storage

The very short description is that this is a schema agnostic JSON document storage
system.  It allows you to easily perform CRUD operations on the documents that you
have stored.  Basic search functionality (documents that match all of these terms)
is provided as well.

What you do with this system is up to you.  I built this with the intention of using
it for doing inventory management of our servers.  You'll see example validators
that do work in this area.

Note that the system is very quick and dirty.  I'd be happy to make it more robust
and efficient, but that wasn't a huge design concern while coding it.

Written by Mark Smith under the employ of Bump Technologies.  Because I'm tired of
there being no damn simple inventory management system.
